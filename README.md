# Lowrezjam22
This is going to be my entry for the Lowrezjam 2022 written in C.

The base commit is the base code that I'm going to start off with. It's still WIP and not thoroughly tested - I just want to show transparency.
It's a custom self-written engine built on top of Raylib with the following features:
* Indexed pixel art rendering: Lines, rectangles, circles, palettes, (affine) sprites
* Free list allocator
* .json parser
* A-Star pathfinder
* Generic arraylist/vector
